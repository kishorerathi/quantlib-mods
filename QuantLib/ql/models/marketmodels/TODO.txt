GENERAL refactoring/review
- Get LMM code in the same use format as other code via instrument classes,
  from LMM -> QL::INSTRUMENT -> EXCEL
- check for null vectors
- check for increasing times
- define equality for evolution description
- split up marktmodel.xlm, qlo\marktmodel.hpp, qlo\marktmodel.cpp
- refactor expcorrflatvol and expcorrabcdvol into genericcorrxxxvol
- RQMC
- swaption calibration using Z matrix with displacements
- verify efficiency of rapid algorithm for reduced factor models
- linear combination of bonds as numeraire
- relevantRates (?)
- ability to terminate simulation on time passed and select termination criterion

TEST
- clean up tests (common market data)
- dedicated drift test
- cotS->fwd and fwd->cotS adapters: inverse, etc
- payment date different from reset dates

Calibration
- calibrator to produce abcd form from market data, with displacements
- caplet cot_swaption calibration

Vol Models
- vol folder
- piecewise abcd adapter

Correlation Models
- move corr models into their own folder
- hist extimation
- Higham cov bug + review rank reduction
- Rapisarda
- longTermCorr+beta+gamma
- Schoenmakers and Coffey (?)

Drift
- verify efficiency of rapid algorithm for reduced factor models
- Glasserman Zhao spot measure approximation
- capc, cani, and PPR terminal measure approximations

Evolvers
- the missing one

Products
- ratchet
- coterminal European swaptions in MC LMM
- coterminal European swaptions using Z matrix
- floorlets with one or many steps.

Greeks
- greeks for swap rate
- greeks for one-step pure-libor non-callable product

Lower bounds
- Fries bias removal
- Jackel method for Bermudan swaptions (time consuming but not hard)
- Anderson method for Bermudan swaptions (time consuming but not hard)

Upper bounds
- Rogers\anderson-Broadie\Joshi methods for upper bounds
- Jamshidian method for upper bounds

Variance reduction
- Control variates, importance sampling (MEDIUM)

Scripting
- Ability to specify new pay-offs and price them without code recompilation.

Statistics
- convergence tables

Path generation:
- antithetic sampling
- moment matching
