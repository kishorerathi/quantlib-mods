        bootstrap a term structure.
        It is advised that a rate helper for an instrument contains an
        instance of the actual instrument class to ensure consistancy
        between the algorithms used during bootstrapping and later
        instrument pricing. This is not yet fully enforced in the
        available rate helpers, though - only SwapRateHelper contains a
        Swap instrument for the time being.
