PORTABILITY

- Version 0.8.0 is the last QuantLib release to support the Metrowerks
  CodeWarrior compiler (which was discountinued by Metrowerks.)  If
  you use such compiler and want support to continue, you can
  volunteer for maintaining the necessary patches: contact the
  QuantLib developers for information.


SOURCE TREE

- Files and folders in the source tree have been reorganized
  (hopefully for th ebetter.) If you only included <ql/quantlib.hpp>,
  all changes were taken care of for you. if you included specific
  headers, you might want to check its current location; in
  particular, all folder names are now lowercase.


CALENDARS

- Added 2007 holidays for Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and South Korea
  calendars.


CASH FLOWS

- Added floater range-accrual coupons.


INDEXES

- Added EuriborSwapFixB family.


INSTRUMENTS

- Added capped/floored floating-rate bond. It can also be used for
  reverse floaters.

- Added delta, gamma and theta to binomial option engines (thanks to
  Steve Cook.)

- Refactored basket engines to allow for more payoffs.


LIBOR MARKET MODEL

- This release includes an experimental implementation of a Libor
  market model developed with Mark Joshi.  Improvements since release
  0.4.0 include normal forward-rate market model, lognormal CMS market
  model, lognormal coterminal-swap market model, and calibration to
  caplets and coterminal swaptions.  The interface of the model and
  its integration with the bulk of the library are still in
  development.


MATH

- Adaptive Gauss-Kronrod integration added.

- Added Higham's nearest correlation matrix method (thanks to Neil
  Firth)

- Refactored optimization framework.


PROCESSES

- Added new discretization schema to Heston process.


UTILITIES

- The Handle class was split into RelinkableHandle (behaving like the
  old Handle class) and Handle (which is notified when its copies are
  relinked, but cannot itself be relinked.) The former can safely be
  returned from inspectors.
