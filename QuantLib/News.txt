??? 2005 - Release 0.3.10
Changes since release 0.3.9:

- The suggested syntax for setting and registering with the global
  evaluation date is now:
     Settings::instance().evaluationDate() = date;
     registerWith(Settings::instance().evaluationDate());

- Added Gaussian quadratures (thanks to Klaus Spanderen.)

- Added generic multi-dimensional stochastic process.

- Added stochastic process array (thanks to Klaus Spanderen.)

- Multi-path generator now takes a generic stochastic process; tests provided.

- Multi-asset option now takes a generic stochastic process.

- Convergence statistics added; tests provided (thanks to Gary Kennedy.)

- Added Heston stochastic-volatility model; tests provided (thanks
  to Klaus Spanderen.)
  - stochastic process
  - analytic and Monte Carlo pricing engines
  - parameter calibration

- New Path class implemented which stores asset values rather than variations:
  - makes pricers independent on whether or not log-variations are stored;
  - enabled when QL_DISABLE_DEPRECATED is defined.

- Cash-flow analyses such as NPV, IRR, convexity and duration added
  (thanks to Charles Whitmore.)
