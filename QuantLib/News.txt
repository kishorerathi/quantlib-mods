PORTABILITY

- Starting with release 0.4.0, the Borland free compiler 5.5 and
  Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 are no longer supported.  If you use one of
  these compilers and want support to continue, you can volunteer for
  maintaining the necessary patches: contact the QuantLib developers
  for information.

CALENDARS

- Added 2007 holidays for Hong Kong, India, Singapore, and Taiwan
  exchanges.

LIBOR MARKET MODEL

- This release includes an experimental implementation of a Libor
  market model developed with Mark Joshi.  Improvements since release
  0.3.14 include the use of quasi-random number generators and the
  calculation of Greeks and of upper bounds for instruments with
  early-exercise features.  The interface of the model and its
  integration with the bulk of the library are still in development.

INSTRUMENTS

- Added helper classes to make it easier to instantiate swaps,
  caps/floors, and CMS instruments.

INTEREST RATES

- Added capped/floored floating-rate coupons (including convexity adjustment.)

MATH

- Curve, domain and surface interfaces added.

PROCESSES

- Added reversion level to Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (thanks to
  Roland Lichters.)

VOLATILITY TERM STRUCTURES

- Added stripping of caplet-volatility term structure from cap quotes.

- Improved SABR interpolation and calibration.
