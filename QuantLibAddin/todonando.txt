D analysis: resize is missing, no bold, no change of font size, no borders, format only 20 columns, accrual days general, accrual period 4 decimals, effective rate 4 digits
- no ScheduleID as input value->blank cell
D permanent comment: TRUE if the object must be permanent (i.e. resistant to garbage collection). Default is FALSE.
D ObjectID comment: id of the object to be created. If missing a unique id will be automatically assigned.
D priority: object builder QuantLib types default (for enumeration use the Excel default), then blank if there is an xml default value, finally exampleValue
D FALSE default value for endofmonth in schedule is not effective
D exampleValue for tenor in schedule is not effective
D exampleValue for rate in FlatForward is not effective
D default for frequency in FlatForward is not effective
D default for gearing in CMSLeg is not effective
D libraryClass='SwapIndex' must default to the EURIBORSWAPFIXA enumeration
D do not input the permanent field
D remove the ObjectID entry field from the form, put the focus in that field after insertion
D another line under the ObjectID field
D constructor for CmsCouponPricer, parameter VanillaCMSCouponPricerType: insert "Convexity Adjustment Type" enumeration drop down list


D (Long) Date
D (Short) Date
D QuantLib::DiscountFactor formatting (9 decimal digits)
D QuantLib::Time formatting (4 decimal digits)

D QuantLib::Money (Currency, symbol None, 2 decimals)
D flow analysis formatting

- - DONE merge Object builder improvements into QuantLib.xla
	->TO BE DISCUSSED: vector input, change in XML file structure to implement default values
-> TO BE REVIEWED check sabr fit stability/accuracy for smilesections
- add atmRate to SmileSection base class
- add an atmRate to our capVol structure
- review the class design together
- refactor abcd vol file, adding more unary_functions for blackVol and covariance
- expose to Excel all these new abcd-related vol functions
- implement abcdinterpolation
- get ready for the second set of main cycle future options
- review workbooks: SmileSectionCaps.xls, SimpleQuote.xls, DerivedQuotes.xls, CapStripperTest3M.xls.
- move the xml folder from Workbooks\ to Framework\. Change both the NSIS files and the path in the .xla
- profiling of the workbooks under the folder Bonds\

- payment business days convention and fixing days
- bond pricing engine
D check asset swap termination date
D check asw when bond redemption != 100
D add Back Payment to par asset swap
D perche' lo yield non ha la frequenza?
- fare tutti i metodi dei bond restituiscano un InterestRate
- i ThMethod perche' non accettano anche loro una Date settlementDate = Date()?
