This is an experimental interface to R.  Generating the wrappers
requires patches to SWIG which can be gotten from
<http://wiki.quantlib.org/twiki/bin/view/Quantlib/RSwig>; the patched
executable should be renamed rswig.

Once you've compiled this you can load with

dyn.load('QuantLib.so')
source('QuantLib_wrap.R')

After you've loaded the library for the first time, you may want to
save the objects generated by QuantLib_wrap.R by 

save(list=ls(all=TRUE),file="QuantLib.RData", compress=TRUE)

The compress option increases loading time, but drastically reduces
the size of the save file.

This will allow 

dyn.load('QuantLib.so')
load(file="QuantLib.RData")

to load the data more quickly.
