<p>If you're new to CVS please read our <a href=
"developerFAQ.shtml#cvs">FAQ</a> and <a href=
"http://sourceforge.net/docman/?group_id=1">SourceForge.net CVS
documentation</a>, especially their <a href=
"http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=765&amp;group_id=1">
CVS FAQ</a>. For general (and more advanced) information consult
the <a href="http://cvsbook.red-bean.com/">free CVS Book</a> and
the <a href="http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs/doc/cvs_toc.html">CVS
Docs at www.loria.fr</a></p>
<p>QuantLib CVS repository includes the following modules:</p>
<ul>
<li>QuantLib (the C++ library)</li>
<li>QuantLib-SWIG (bindings for Python, Ruby, MzScheme and
Guile.)</li>
<li>QuantLibXL (the Excel add-in)</li>
<li>QuantLib-site (the HTML sources of these pages)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Please note that QuantLib modules have capital Q and capital
L.</em></p>
<p>You can <a href=
"http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/quantlib/">browse
the CVS tree</a>: this gives you a view into the current status of
the project's code. You may also view the complete histories of any
file in the repository.</p>
<h3>Anonymous CVS Access</h3>
<p>The modules can be checked out through anonymous (pserver) CVS
with the following instruction set. The module you wish to check
out must be specified as the modulename. When prompted for a
password for anonymous, simply press the Enter key.</p>
<p>Unix:</p>
<pre>
export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.quantlib.org:/cvsroot/quantlib
cvs login
cvs -z3 co -P modulename
</pre>
<p>Win32:</p>
<pre>
SET CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.quantlib.org:/cvsroot/quantlib
cvs login
cvs -z3 co -P modulename
</pre>
<p>After initial checkout, you can execute cvs commands in this
directory without the CVSROOT exporting/setting. For example:</p>
<pre>
cvs update
</pre>
<p>If you are behind a firewall ask your sysadmin to open the
cvspserver port (2401) for outgoing connection from your machine to
cvs.quantlib.org<br>
<!--
If he refuses to allow an outgoing connection from one well
defined machine (yours) to one well defined remote server on one
specific port he is taking security to a pointless level that
merely impedes the users' work flow, impairs the functionality of
the network, and doesn't provide any extra security unless your
sysadmin believes his network to be infested with backdoor
trojans that might try to phone home on the port used by the CVS
protocol, in which case he should be busy disinfecting the
workstations rather than trying to stop them opening outgoing
connections.
-->
Alternatively, if you are behind a strict firewall, you can
download the <a href=
"http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cvstarballs/quantlib-cvsroot.tar.bz2">nightly
backup tarball</a> of the CVS repository. You'll need to install it
as a local CVS repository to use it. However, we advise against
such operation as the tarball size exceeds 60 MB at the time of
this writing.</p>
<p>Finally, another possibility (untested at this time) might be to
use an http grabber such as <a
href="http://cvsgrab.sourceforge.net">CVSGrab</a> or <a
href="http://www.angelfire.com/rnb/sfcvs/">sfcvs</a>. We'll be
grateful to anyone reporting success or failure with these
packages.</p>

<h3>Developer CVS Access via SSH</h3>
<p>If you are a SourceForge.net-recognized QuantLib developer you
can access the CVS tree via SSH (SSH must be installed on your
client machine). To check if this is the case try the shell login.
Substitute developername with the proper value:</p>
<pre>
ssh -l developername quantlib.org
groups
</pre>
<p>You have to perform the shell login at least once, in order to
have your user directory created. If the shell login is OK (type
<em>exit</em> to log off), you can check out modules from the
QuantLib CVS. Substitute modulename and developername with the
proper values, enter your site password when prompted:</p>
<p>Unix:</p>
<pre>
export CVSROOT=developername@cvs.quantlib.org:/cvsroot/quantlib
export CVS_RSH=ssh
cvs -z3 co -P modulename
</pre>
<p>Win32:</p>
<pre>
SET CVSROOT=developername@cvs.quantlib.org:/cvsroot/quantlib
SET CVS_RSH=ssh
cvs -z3 co -P modulename
</pre>
<p>After initial checkout, you can change into this directory and
execute cvs commands without the CVSROOT exporting/setting. For
example:</p>
<pre>
cvs update
cvs commit -m "comments for this commit"
cvs add myfile.c
</pre>
<p>If you are behind a firewall you need to open the ssh port (22)
for outgoing connection from your machine to quantlib.org,
shell.sf.net, and upload.sf.net (the latter just in case you plan
to help the QuantLib release process).</p>
<p><strong>Note for C++ Unix users</strong>: if you use CVS, you
will need some GNU tools that usually only developers use, and
which are not required to build QuantLib from tarballs. These are
automake, autoconf, libtool, GNU m4, GNU make, and others which
might escape me now. They all come with recent GNU/Linux
distributions.</p>
<p>To begin the build process from a CVS checkout, start with:</p>
<pre>
sh ./autogen.sh
</pre>
<p>which will prepare the package for compilation. You can then use
<em>./configure</em> and <em>make</em> in the usual way.</p>
