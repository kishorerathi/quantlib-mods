<h1 class="center">Developer introduction</h1>
<p>Developers willing to contribute to the QuantLib project may
contact the QuantLib developers' mailing list (&lt;quantlib-dev at
lists.sourceforge.net&gt;) and describe their experience and
interests. You might want to specify an area of the library you are
particularly interested to, or which would be most useful to
you. Asking the administrators to choose a task for you is ok, but it
might take time to get an answer and it increases the odds that the
chosen task will bore you or otherwise discourage you from completing
it.</p>
<p>Should you want to review a list of needed tasks, the project
overview (<a href=
"http://quantlib.org/reference/overview.html">http://quantlib.org/reference/overview.html</a>)
contains a list of generic to-do items; a more low-level list is
available at <a href=
"http://quantlib.org/reference/todo.html">http://quantlib.org/reference/todo.html</a>.
We also suggest that you take a look at our QuantLib Enhancement
Proposals (<a href=
"http://quantlib.org/quep.shtml">http://quantlib.org/quep.shtml</a>):
if you plan some large contribution you may want to write one
before you start coding. It will be a very useful effort since it
will be re-cycled as documentation when you actually implement your
ideas.</p>
<p>Feel free to post to quantlib-dev@lists.sourceforge.net your
development ideas, contribution and sample code (you will need to
subscribe to the list first; see <a href=
"http://quantlib.org/mailinglists.shtml">&lt;http://quantlib.org/mailinglists.shtml&gt;</a>.)
Submitting a patch would be the easiest way to get your
contribution into the QuantLib code tree; see the FAQ (<a href=
"http://quantlib.org/faq.shtml">http://quantlib.org/faq.shtml</a>)
for details.</p>
<p>To keep up with the QuantLib development - so that your
contribution will apply to the latest source code tree - you will
need to familiarize with CVS: see <a href=
"http://quantlib.org/cvs.shtml">&lt;http://quantlib.org/cvs.shtml&gt;</a>
for an introduction.</p>
<p>After having established yourself as a trusted contributor, you
might be granted write access to the CVS tree. In that case, you
will need a SourceForge account; see <a href=
"http://sourceforge.net">&lt;http://sourceforge.net&gt;</a>. You
might also need a few developer tools besides CVS: please read the
Developer FAQ (<a href=
"http://quantlib.org/developerFAQ.shtml">http://quantlib.org/developerFAQ.shtml</a>.)</p>
<p>We might need to ask for a disclaimer from your employer stating
that your contribution can be released under the QuantLib license;
such disclaimer shouldn't be necessary if you own the copyright of the
code. An example of such disclaimer can be found at <a href=
"http://quantlib.org/templates/disclaimer.rtf">&lt;http://quantlib.org/templates/disclaimer.rtf&gt;</a>,
but you can write your own along the same lines if the wording doesn't
suit your employer.</p>
<p>Finally, note that the above is a list of suggestion, not
requirements. The QuantLib team can help you on any issue; don't
let details stop you.</p>
