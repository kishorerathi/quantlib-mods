ObjectHandler

Integration of a generic C++ library such as QuantLib into spreadsheets and
other end user tools requires a standalone ObjectHandler component, a
repository allowing objects to be stored, shared, updated, interrogated, and
destroyed.

QuantLibXL
http://www.quantlibxl.org
http://www.quantlibaddin.org

QuantLibAddin implements an interface supporting a subset of QuantLib
functionality. Constructor, member and utility functions are defined in XML
metadata from which Python application gensc generates source code for
supported platforms including Microsoft Excel and OpenOffice.Org Calc.

QuantLibXL is the implementation of QuantLibAddin for Microsoft Excel.  The
QuantLibXL project includes a binary release comprising a compiled Addin and
related spreadsheets.
