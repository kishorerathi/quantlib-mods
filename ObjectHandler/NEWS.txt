Release 0.1.3 - March 2006

CORE

- Documentation revised and extended

EXCEL

- unregister functions when XLL unloaded (Lars Schouw)
- Consolidated export of Excel functions
- Increased granularity and clarity of runtime exceptions
- Improved memory management (automatic deletion of temp variables)
- Clarified code in example XLLs

LOG4CXX

- Link to log4cxx statically rather than dynamically.  The use of log4cxx.dll,
  introduced in ObjectHandler version 0.1.2, was found to destabilize
  ObjectHandler and so the static link to log4cxx, used in ObjectHandler
  version 0.1.1, has been reintroduced.

Release 0.1.2 - October 2005

EXCEL

Excel binding ported from QuantLibAddin to ObjectHandler
and enhanced:

- ObjectHandler core functionality and the Excel binding can be
  linked statically into a single client XLL, or built as a standalone
  XLL comprising a global repository shared by multiple client XLLs
- garbage collection of objects orphaned by the deletion of the
  calling cell
- conversion to/from all Excel types and native C++ types
- greater granularity of datatypes - XLOPER replaced by OPER, FP
