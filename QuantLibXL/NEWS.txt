???Added LegMethods spreadsheet
Modified : /trunk/QuantLibAddin/gensrc/metadata/Functions/leg.xml

New functions:
- qlBondEngine: constructor of the bond engine which takes as input a discounting yield term structure
- qlPeriodEquivalent: function to return the period equivalent to the input (e.g it returns 1Y3M for 1Y6M-3M, 0M for 1Y-12M, 3W5D for 3W+5D, 2W2D for 3W-5D, etc)
- caps stripping: added new class 'qlCapTermVolatilityVector' and method 'qlCapTermVolatilityVectorInterpVol' to construct a cap term volatility vector and interpolate along option tenors using cubic spline interpolator. No smile is taken into account.

Covered Warrants:
Operations on financial markets with regard to covered warrants on interest rates derivatives are about to kick off. Static data of the instruments are collected and managed in
Workbooks/CoveredWarrants/CoveredWarrants.xls where isins and feedcodes have been updated to get ready for contribution to ORC. In the same workbooks real-time theoretical prices are calculated and automatically imported to ORC.

Indexes:
- Indexes are no longer enumerated objects, we're now relying on user-created Indexes (see workbooks in folder Workbooks/Indexes)
- Historic fixings are loaded by means of qlIndexAddFixings performing size checks and preventing non intentional fixing overwriting

Others:
- YieldCurveBootstrapping.xls: 6M deposit is now included in the curve bootstrapping
- Swaption volatility smile: modified calculation of interpolated spreads. Spreads on ATM volatilities in sparse cube are now taken into account. A small error is introduced in the calculation of ATM volatilities in dense cube, negligible in case of good fit
- The discount curve parameter has been removed from the Swaption constructor and has been moved to the BlackSwaptionEngine constructor
- qlSabrInterpolatedSmileSection has been modified to filter dynamically market quotes as they become available
- qlSabrSmileSection is now dependent (observer) of the evaluation date so that when the EvaluationDate changes the SabrSmileSection class is recomputed accordingly

Workbooks:
- MarketData/ReutersFeed/MMIndicesAddLastFixing.xls: displays before and after fixing forecasts (compared with observed fixing)
- MainChecks.xls: added Real-Time monitoring
- Bonds/Z-Spread.xls: added bond engine 
- Tests/BondvsSwap.xls: added cash-flow analysis comparison
- Tests/BondvsSwap.xls: compares dirty theoretical price of a fixed rate bond to fixed swap leg market value with valuation date equal to bond settlement date
