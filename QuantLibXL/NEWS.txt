  with a leg with embedded option of type digital cash-or-nothing or
  asset-or-nothing, the option being either a call or a put, with a short or a
  long position. The digital option may account for ATM inclusion or exclusion
  in the payoff through a specific input parameter. Pricing is based on a
  replication strategy, which can be a central, sub, or super replication. The
  gap in the replication is 1 bp by default. Related workbooks are:
- Workbooks/Tests/DigitalLegReplicationType.xls

  qlSwaptionVolCube1 can accept the optimizer in input

Volatilities:
- qlSpreadedSwaptionVolatilityStructure and qlSpreadedCapletVolatilityStructure

  given SimpleQuote object


**************************
    REV10747
**************************

  they return clean and dirty price for a given bond object whe inputing a zero
  coupon spread.

  excel and used in BondMonitor_EUR.xls and BondFunctions.xls

BUG FIXES:
