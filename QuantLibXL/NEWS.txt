Bug fixing:

Digital Coupon:
  Related functions are qlDigitalIborLeg and qlDigitalCmsLeg to price swaps
  with a leg with embedded option of type digital cash-or-nothing or
  asset-or-nothing, the option being either a call or a put, with a short or a
  long position. The digital option may account for ATM inclusion or exclusion
  in the payoff through a specific input parameter. Pricing is based on a
  replication strategy, which can be a central, sub, or super replication. The
  gap in the replication is 1 bp by default. Related workbooks are:
- Workbooks/Tests/DigitalLegReplicationType.xls
- Workbooks/ Tests /SwapWithDigitalLeg.xls

Bonds:
- corrected static data for: DE0001345759  and IT0001327524
- Z-SpreadTest.xls added in Tests folder to check the correctness of
  qlCleanPriceFromZSpread and qlDirtyPriceFromZSpread functions for fixed rate,
  floating rate, cms rate and zero coupon bonds
- qlBondPreviousCoupon: new method added to return the previous coupon paid for
  the given bond. The default bond settlement is used if no date is given
- asset swap: correctly handles the creation of a new bond type, the cms rate
  bond in addition to fixed rate and floating rate coupon bonds
- AssetSwapPricesTest.xls: added test cases for fixed, floater, and cms bonds
  maturing on a day which isn't a business day according to the bond's calendar
  (IT0003543847, XS0228052402 and IT0006527060)
- MainChecks.xls: contains checks for a fixed coupon bond, a floating rate
  coupon bond, and cms coupon bond

Calibrations:
- Workbooks\CmsCalibrations\MultiIndexSingleMeanRevCalibration.xls and
  Workbooks\MarketMetaData\SwaptionVols1.xls: added the choice between Simplex
  and Levenberg-Marquardt optimizers, set up reasonable parameters values, and
  extensive tests.
- qlSwaptionVolCube1 and qlSABRInterpolation: extended signature so that
  qlSwaptionVolCube1 can accept the optimizer in input

Volatilities:
- qlSpreadedSwaptionVolatilityStructure and qlSpreadedCapletVolatilityStructure
  to add a scalar to volatility matrix and cube. Accordingly provided this
  functionality in RangeAccrualFloaters.xls, Swaption.xls, Swap.xls,
  MultiLegSwap.xls, MakeCMS.xls, MakeCapFloor.xls, CMS.xls, CapFloor.xls,
  AssetSwap.xls

Market Models:

NEW FUNCTIONS:
- qlBondCleanPriceFromZSpread and qlBondDirtyPriceFromZspread:
