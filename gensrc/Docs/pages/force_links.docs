This dummy file is used as a workaround for a problem with the compiled help
(.chm) file.

When the chm file is compiled, the only images that are detected are those
that appear in html.  Images that appear only in css files are excluded from
the chm file.

This file explicitly lists all images for the site, forcing their inclusion
in the chm file.
